      question: "How do I earn SOL tokens through quizzes?",
      answer: "When you win a quiz match against another player, you'll earn SOL tokens based on the stake amount and difficulty level. The rewards are automatically sent to your connected Solana wallet after the match concludes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my SOL safe on the platform?",
      answer: "Yes, we never take custody of your funds. All transactions happen directly through your connected wallet, and smart contracts ensure fair distribution of rewards. Your SOL remains in your wallet until you decide to stake it for a quiz."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I lose connection during a quiz?",
      answer: "If you lose connection during a quiz, you'll have a short grace period to reconnect. If you can't reconnect within that time, the match will be considered forfeit and your stake may be lost. We recommend having a stable internet connection before starting a quiz."
    },
    {
      question: "How are quiz questions created and verified?",
      answer: "Our questions are created by blockchain experts and go through a rigorous verification process to ensure accuracy. We regularly update our question bank to reflect the latest developments in the Solana ecosystem."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I create my own quizzes?",
      answer: "Premium subscribers can create custom quizzes and challenge friends or the community. Custom quizzes can be private or public, and you can set your own stake amounts and rules."
